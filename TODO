* Speed up unit testing

  Since the unit tests also use the sqlite db, they are
  significantly slower than before. This could be sped up
  with the proper architecture (we should test the logic
  in Statistic separately from the database).

* Move some unit tests into the features

  A few tests are admittedly not meant to be unittests,
  but rather part of an end-to-end test suite.

* Test-module matcher

  In order to run only the tests in the relevant files,
  we should check what is imported in a test file, build
  a table from it and check if a file is really relevant
  to a module. Fortunately, ast.parse is really versatile. :)

* Python 2.6 and 2.4 support if possible

  Python 2.7 is already supported, but it might be good
  to backport to older Python versions, in case someone
  needs it.
