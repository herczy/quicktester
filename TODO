* Test-module matcher

  In order to run only the tests in the relevant files,
  we should check what is imported in a test file, build
  a table from it and check if a file is really relevant
  to a module. Fortunately, ast.parse is really versatile. :)

* Add contrib files and vim plugin

  I have an idea that ties together these patches that's
  perfectly suited for vim users. This would basically run
  only git changes and if there was a failure then only
  re-run the failing cases. All this is with the quickfix,
  so jumping between trace positions would be simple.



* Speed up unit testing

  Since the unit tests also use the sqlite db, they are
  significantly slower than before. This could be sped up
  with the proper architecture (we should test the logic
  in Statistic separately from the database).

  [done: unit tests are under 1sec at this time]

* Move some unit tests into the features

  A few tests are admittedly not meant to be unittests,
  but rather part of an end-to-end test suite.

  [done: removed tests that were better suited for other levels]

* Python 2.6 and 2.4 support if possible

  Python 2.7 is already supported, but it might be good
  to backport to older Python versions, in case someone
  needs it.

  [failed: Py2.6 is simply too different from 2.7+]
