- statistics: use a new, sqlite3-based format. This statistics
  file contains the passed tests as well. The old format can still
  be loaded.
- git-changes: alternative mapping. This feature makes it
  possible to use quicktester if your tests aren't nested
  under the tested package but rather reside in a separate
  path.
- git-changes: the name mapping option tries to map filenames
  to their test modules. So if 'package/module.py' is changed,
  'package/tests/test_module.py' is run.
- quickfix: show the exception at the beginning of a trace. This
  way separating what lines belong to what exceptions are
  easier to do.
- quickfix: In Python 3+, show the whole exception chain in
  the quickfix file.
- Added a VIM plugin for making quicktester easier to use with it.
- Major test cleanup resulting in faster test runs.
